## Crystal Game

This is a fun and interactive game using javascript where four crystals carry a random value at each round. When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. 

Every time the player clicks on the crystals, their score is updated. The value of the crystal is hidden until the player clicks on it. 

At the start of each round, the player is shown a random number that is the targeted number to be reached. The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game. The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.
